# Cellular Automata and Conway's "Game of Life"

Welcome to John Conway's "Game of Life"! This is a computer science
classic from 1970, a program that simulates a _cellular automaton_
(plural _automata_). It has connections to all kinds of different
aspects of computer science and nature.

Over the course of this week, students will work on creating their own
application in which users will be able to run different "Game of Life"
scenarios. This module leads the reader through the fundamentals of
Conways's "Game of Life" and will guide them through the process of
creating an app utilizing tools and frameworks that have been taught
over the course of their specific track.

Rules

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
